Gammapy Logo
============

The logo and banner was made by Christoph Deil.
If I ever have to reproduce it, here's the procedure:

* Use LaTeXiT [1] and OmniGraffle [2].
* Type ``\gamma`` and ``pi`` with font size 200 in LaTeXiT
* Copy as PDF into OmniGraffle ... it's linked between the apps.
* Select orange and gray colors from the Astropy webpage
* Write text as 36 pt Helvetica Neue Light and also select colors
* Make ``Python`` and ``gamma-ray`` bold
* Make a version with white instead of gray (for dark backgrounds)
* Export logo and banner to PDF and using 200 dpi to PNG (transparent background)
* Use [3] to create 32 pix and 64 pix versions of the logo (ico and png)
* Put the following files into the main repo ``gammapy/docs/_static``
* Check locally or on readthedocs that the banner, logo and ico are OK.
