gammapy-extra
=============

The main `gammapy` repository is located at
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy
and contains the code and Sphinx docs.

The `gammapy-extra` repository is located at
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra
and contains everything that is considered too large
in terms of filesize to be part of the main repo.

Currently we have the following folders:

* `datasets` : Gammapy example datasets
* `notebooks` : Gammapy IPython notebooks
* `logo` : Gammapy logo and banner

Jupyter notebooks stored in **notebooks** folder may be also found in the
`Gammapy documentation website <http://docs.gammapy.org/en/latest/tutorials.html>`__
as fixed-text Sphinx formatted files, as well as in the
`NBViewer platform <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gammapy/gammapy-extra/blob/master/index.ipynb>`__.
